# SQL Cheat Sheet

## 1. Basic Query Structure

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, â€¦
FROM main_table
[JOIN other_table ON join_condition]
[WHERE filter]
[GROUP BY column_list]
[HAVING group_filter]
[ORDER BY column ASC|DESC]
[LIMIT n OFFSET m];
```

## 2. Set Operations
- UNION / UNION ALL: combine result sets (UNION removes duplicates)
- INTERSECT: intersection of result sets
- EXCEPT (or MINUS): difference between result sets

```sql
SELECT col1, col2
FROM tableA
UNION      -- or UNION ALL / INTERSECT / EXCEPT
SELECT col3, col4
FROM tableB
ORDER BY col1 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 2. Subqueries
### 2.1. Simple Subquery
```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales_associates
WHERE salary > (
  SELECT AVG(revenue)
  FROM sales_associates
);
```
